    "## DataFrames and Series in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built around the data types: DataFrames, Series.  Roughly, a Series is a list of indices and values (think of a time series where the datatime is the index), and a DataFrame is a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are entire Series, and these Series have a common index.  You can think of a list having integer indices, i.e. `somelist[50]` will give you the 50th entry of the list.  In R, the row indices are primarily indices, while Pandas is designed for use with indices of various types.  Because a Series is like a vector with arbitrary indices, you can element-wise add, subtract, divide two Series with common indices.  DataFrames are tables that you can join, group, transform, and slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen how to read DataFrames from CSVs, so let's focus on how to slice the DataFrame.  There are several ways to do this: with an index range, by column names, with a boolean Series, using the `DataFrame.loc, DataFrame.iloc` methods.  Many of these should be familiar to the R programmer, while some are new.  In some sense, Pandas makes indexing mandatory, so that if your index is a datetime or location, then you are discouraged from slicing by integer ranges (although you can always use iloc).  Indexing is primarily how Pandas is different from numpy, and why DataFrames are different from matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint:** go through the sections on Series and DataFrames in the following <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html\">Pandas documentation</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Series can accommodate elementwise operations, and it has similar slicing to DataFrames, with a few exceptions.  It is important to understand the difference between a DataFrame and a Series.  Really, a DataFrame is a Series valued dictionary.  There are many ways to initialize a DataFrame.  While it is more common to create a DataFrame by reading it from files, it is good to know how to do this.  Keep in mind that if you are creating a list, dictionary, etc. from a DataFrame and then creating a new DataFrame, then there may be a more efficient way to do what you're doing using Pandas directly."
