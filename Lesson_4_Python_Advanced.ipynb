    "\n",
    "Python has many built in functions that are always available to the user.  See [the following documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). You should learn their uses, since many are very helful.  Most of them operate on broad classes of objects.  For example, `enumerate()` operates on any container, which are lists, tuple, sets, dictionaries.  The main types that you should know how to use extensively are list, tuple, set, dict, str, int, float, function.  You can initialize these types by calling  `int('134')` for example.  Running the cell below will show the docstring for the int type."

Iterables are types for which the `iter` method is defined, which is how for loops work in python.  Containers are iterable, and the resulting iterator will allow you to iterate through its elements.  For example, the following two cells do the same thing."

It is inefficient for looking up the index for a certain value.  This is because `list.index` will look up the index for that value by iterating through the list until the value is found.  This means that the amount of time that this can take will scale like the length of the list (we say that this takes $O(n)$ time where $n$ is the length of the list).  If you want to do fast index lookups you have two main options: a dictionary for reverse lookups, or a sortedlist.\n",

So if you call `hash('james')` then you see the hash value of a string, which determines where the value is stored in memory.  This means that to find a value of a key, you only need to evaluate the hash function of the key.  This means that lookups take constant time.  The drawback is that the hash table takes up perhaps an unneccessary amount of memory.  You also need to use keys that are hashable, such as strings, ints, floats.\n",

Bisection will look at the mid-point in the sorted list and determine if the query is greater than or less than that value.  Then you can rule out half of the list, and continue bisecting in the other half recursively until you find the value.  This means that it takes $O(\\log n)$ time to do the lookup.  Look at the code below from the scrabble dictionary reverse lookup example."
